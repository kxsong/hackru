Usage: python yt_repost.py subreddit [last_ID]
requires a username/password file at ~/username.txt. It should have two lines: the first being the screenname, the second being the password

Requires Python requests: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests

ideas for improvements: 
use reddit api wrapper: https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api
a more secure way of storing username+password

compatible with python 2.6.6
